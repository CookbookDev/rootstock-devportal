# **Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct**

Do we have this?

**How to Start?**

If you are worried or don’t know where to start, check out the next section that explains what kind of help we could use and where you can get involved. 

You can send your questions on [Discord](http://discord.gg/rootstock), send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsksmart.github.io/pulls) or [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsksmart.github.io/issues), and a maintainer will attend to it\!

**Submit a Pull Request 🚀**

Branch naming convention is as following

`AREA-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

**Example:**

`doc-001-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`

When `AREA` can be:

- feat \- a new feature  
- doc \- documentation only changes  
- fix \- a bug fix  
- refactor \- code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

All PRs must include a commit message with the description of the changes made\!

## **Writing Commit Messages**

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")  
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")  
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less  
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:  
  * 🎨 :art: when improving the format/structure of the code  
  * 🐎 :racehorse: when improving performance  
  * 🚱 :non-potable\_water: when plugging memory leaks  
  * 📝 :memo: when writing docs  
  * 🐧 :penguin: when fixing something on Linux  
  * 🍎 :apple: when fixing something on macOS  
  * 🏁 :checkered\_flag: when fixing something on Windows  
  * 🐛 :bug: when fixing a bug  
  * 🔥 :fire: when removing code or files  
  * 💚 :green\_heart: when fixing the CI build  
  * ✅ :white\_check\_mark: when adding tests  
  * 🔒 :lock: when dealing with security
