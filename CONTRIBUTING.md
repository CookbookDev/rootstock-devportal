## Rootstock Contribution Guide

Are you passionate about web3, bitcoin and the Blockchain? Do you have a passion for Open Source and Web3? Do you enjoy writing, coding, bounty hunting, solving real-world problems, and eager to contribute to the future of Bitcoin and Decentralized Finance? Join the [Rootstock Discord Community](http://discord.gg/rootstock) and start making contributions!

All contributions are welcome, including issues, updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

**How to Start?**

If you are worried or don’t know where to start, check out the next section that explains what kind of help we could use and where you can get involved. 

You can send your questions on [Discord](http://discord.gg/rootstock), send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsksmart.github.io/pulls) or [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsksmart.github.io/issues), and a maintainer will attend to it\!

**Submit a Pull Request 🚀**

Branch naming convention is as following

`AREA-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

**Example:**

`doc-001-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`

When `AREA` can be:

- feat \- a new feature  
- doc \- documentation only changes  
- fix \- a bug fix  
- refactor \- code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

All PRs must include a commit message with the description of the changes made\!

## **Writing Commit Messages**

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")  
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")  
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less  
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:  
  * 🎨 :art: when improving the format/structure of the code  
  * 🐎 :racehorse: when improving performance  
  * 🚱 :non-potable\_water: when plugging memory leaks

  * 🐛 :bug: when fixing a bug  
  * 🔥 :fire: when removing code or files  
  * 💚 :green\_heart: when fixing the CI build
