Covalent provides the industry-leading Unified API bringing visibility to billions of Web3 data points. Developers use Covalent to build exciting multi-chain applications like crypto wallets, NFT galleries, and investor dashboard tools utilizing data from 100+ blockchains including Rootstock.

The Covalent API maintains a full archival copy of every supported blockchain, meaning every balance, transaction, log event, and NFT asset data is available from the genesis block. This data is available via:

1. [Unified API](#unified-api) - Incorporate blockchain data into your app with a familiar REST API
2. [Increment](#increment) - Create and embed custom charts with no-code analytics

### Why use Covalent?

Use Covalent if you need:
* Structured and enhanced on-chain data well beyond what you get from RPC providers
* Broad and deep multi-chain data at scale
* Enterprise-grade performance
