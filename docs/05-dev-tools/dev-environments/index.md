Dev Environments provide a complete set of tools for writing, testing, and deploying your smart contracts on Rootstock. 

Some benefits of using a dev environment:

* Streamlined Workflow: No need to cobble together tools from different sources â€“ everything you need is in one place.
* Efficiency: Dev environments automate repetitive tasks, saving you time and effort.
* Error Reduction: Built-in features can help you catch bugs in your code before deployment.
