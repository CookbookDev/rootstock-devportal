## Faucets

* [Rootstock Faucet](https://faucet.rootstock.io/): Get free RBTC testnet tokens for development and testing.
* [RIF Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.rifos.org/): Obtain free RIF testnet tokens to explore the RIF ecosystem.

## Gas Fees
* [Rootstock Gas Station](https://rskgasstation.info/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1): Estimate gas fees for your transactions on the Rootstock network.

## Exchanges - Getting RBTC

To acquire RBTC or RIF, you can use various methods:

* Exchanges: Purchase RBTC or RIF on cryptocurrency exchanges that support them. See the [RBTC](https://rootstock.io/rbtc/) section to get started. To get RIF, see the [RIF Token](https://rif.technology/rif-token/) section.
* Bridges: Transfer your tokens from other blockchains to the Rootstock network using bridges.

## Code Quality

To ensure the quality and security of your smart contracts, consider using these tools:

* Sourcify: Verify and document your Solidity contracts to enhance transparency and readability.
* Slither: Identify potential vulnerabilities and optimize your codebase for efficiency and security.

## dApp Testing

Effectively test your dApps with these tools:

* Cucumber: Write clear and concise test scenarios using Gherkin syntax. Get started using the [dApp automation with Cucumber and Playwright](/resources/tutorials/dapp-automation-cucumber)
* Playwright: Automate browser interactions to simulate real-world user behavior.
* Synpress: Specifically designed for dApp testing, seamlessly integrates with MetaMask and other wallets.

## Mining Tools
