This guide provides a step-to-step for developers to interact with Rootstock network by using [Alchemy RPC provider service](https://www.alchemy.com/). 

It aims to address the challenges faced by developers when trying to access critical information like logs, transactions, and balances through RPC, which can significantly impact the timely development of dApps on the Rootstock blockchain.

In this guide you will learn:
- How to create an Alchemy project to make your first API call.
- View some options to interact with the node RPC with the Alchemy sdk and tools.


## Prerequisites

Before you start using the Alchemy RPC API to interact with the Rootstock network, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of smart contracts and how to interact with them on the Rootstock blockchain.
- Familiarity with Ethereum-based dApp development can be helpful.
- Development Environment: Ensure you have a development environment set up for interacting with blockchain nodes. 
- Basic Programming Knowledge: Knowledge of JavaScript, Python, or other supported languages to make API calls. And familiarity with making HTTP requests and handling JSON responses.

## Who is it for?
- dApp Developers looking to interact with the Rootstock nodes.

## Features
### Easy Setup:
- Create an API key effortlessly to initiate development.
- Make the First API call in minutes.

### API Key Authentication:
- Provides secure authentication for decentralized applications (dApps).
- Limits API requests on a daily or monthly basis.
