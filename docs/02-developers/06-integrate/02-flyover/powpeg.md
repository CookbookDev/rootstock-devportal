The [PowPeg](http://powpeg.rootstock.io) app is a user-friendly interface for the conversion of BTC to RBTC and vice versa. It is secured by the [powpeg protocol](/concepts/powpeg/), which is a unique 2-way peg system that allows users to natively transfer bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain to the Rootstock blockchain and vice versa, creating a token called RBTC that is pegged to the value of Bitcoin. The PowPeg protocol works by locking bitcoins in a multi-signature address on the Bitcoin side and releasing an equivalent amount of RBTC on the Rootstock side. Read more in the [Glossary](/developers/integrate/flyover/glossary/) section.

The PowPeg app uses the Flyover SDK + PowPeg protocol natively to facilitate faster conversions of BTC to RBTC and vice-versa.
