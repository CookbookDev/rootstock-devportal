Welcome to the Rootstock Developers Overview section. 

This section enables developers getting started with the Rootstock blockchain. Developers can install a local development environment using Hardhat, etc, create and test contracts with the libraries provided and use the libraries to build decentralized applications 

> Looking to interact with the Rootstock node? Use the [RPC API](https://rpc.rootstock.io/). View the [docs](./07-json-rpc/)
