Welcome to the Rootstock Developers Overview section. 

This section enables developers getting started with the Rootstock blockchain. Developers can install a local development environment using Hardhat, etc, create and test contracts with the libraries provided and use the libraries to build decentralized applications 

> Looking to quickly test your dApp on testnet before deploying to mainnet? Use the [RPC API](https://rpc.rootstock.io/) or view the [json-rpc methods](/developers/rpc-api/methods/) available on the RPC API.
